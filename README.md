OPEN STUDENT BOOK
=================

Hello World!!! I'm Edoardo Viola and I'm an Mozilla Volunteer.  From this August I started to think to write a little guide to introduce the Open Projects and the Open Source at the students of all the Faculties in the Universities. It's important to make known the potentiality and why is important work in Open Projects and with their communities not only for the humankind in general but for himself.

I think that this project too could be a good start to who wants to tests the potentiality to work togheter, mixing our passions, skills and thinking in one Open project. Here all the thinking concerning our goals are accepted and the method of work is inclusive for everyone.

What you need to work
---------------------

* Be a Students, Teacher, Researcher or PhD at the University, otherwise, be a Worker with an University Degree
* Have the passion or wants to start to be a volunteer in a Community who works in a Open Project

Every Weeks we will make a Call or a Chat to talk about the Project and what we will done and the next steps. We will use this [Etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/PlaybookUniversitario) to track all the informations and to have a recap of all Calls maked.
